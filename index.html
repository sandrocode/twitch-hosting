    <h1>How to easily host a channel on Twitch?</h1>
    <h2>Why streamers ask to you to host their channel?</h2>
    <p>
      Because hosting is one of the best (free) way to support your favorite
      streamers and help them to grow up their channel. When you're hosting a
      channel, Twitch gives more exposure to the channel and it's a huge help to
      catch new people. More people host the channel, more exposure the channel
      earn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: it seems auto hosting doesn't work anymore since Twitch updated some
      things a few months ago. So the goal of this guide is to explain you how
      to easily (manually) host a channel.

    <p>
      You should be in your <strong>Streamer Manager</strong>. At the right you
      have your own chat. Type <code>/host ChannelName</code>. Replace
      <code>ChannelName</code> by name of the channel so per example
      <code>/host AlexKakoMusic</code>.

      There is an easier way to host a channel on a computer. The BTTV
      extension. This extension add a lot of features to your Twitch. Focus on
      the HOST BUTTON feature.
    </p>
    <p>
      First you have to install the BTTV extension.
      <a href="https://betterttv.com/">Click here and download it</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then go to the BTTV settings. In whatever chat click on the gear icon then
      on BetterTTV settings.
    </p>
    <img src="./img/bttv-settings.png" width="202" height="312" alt="" />
    <p>
      Click on the channel settings icon, scroll down a bit and enable the HOST
      BUTTON feature.
    </p>
    <img src="./img/bttv-host-button.png" width="498" height="314" alt="" />
    <p>
      Now you have a HOST BUTTON everywhere and the only thing you have to do to
      host a channel is to click on it.

      You can also host from anywhere using the iOS and Android mobile apps. To
      enable Host Mode on the go, tap the video player, then the
      <strong>Share</strong>&nbsp;button, then&nbsp;<strong>Host Channel</strong
      >.
